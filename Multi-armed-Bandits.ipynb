    "# Multi-armed Bandits Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explains and reproduces the most popular multi-armed bandits (MAB) algorithms:\n",
    "- epsilon-greedy\n",
    "- UCB\n",
    "- Thompson Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "### What?\n",
    "MAB is a classic reinforcement learning problem for balancing the trade-off between exploration vs exploitation.\n",
    "Essentially, MAB formulates various kinds of sequential decision-making problems; thus, it is applicable to a wide range of scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "In a casino, a gambler plays a slot machine that has `K` pulling arms (the story if there are `K` slot machines with one arm). \n",
    "How to leave the casino without being bankrupt? Or even with some earnings?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Rules\n",
    "1. Each arm has a reward distribution that is initially unknown to the gambler.\n",
    "2. Each round, the gambler can only play one arm and only observe the reward of that very arm.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Goal\n",
    "Maximize the cumulative reward before he bankrupts or the casino closes."
